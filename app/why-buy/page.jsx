          <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800">About our accounts</h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            We provide a variety of verified social media accounts that can be purchased legally through our website. All accounts are unique and registered using different phone numbers and email addresses. They come from diverse user profiles and countries so you can choose the type that best fits your use case.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            You can choose younger accounts for short-term campaigns or older accounts for long-term reliability. Some accounts in our inventory were registered years ago and have seen little to no activity — which makes them suitable for many business needs.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            After purchase, to reduce the risk of blocks or security flags, avoid repeatedly logging into multiple accounts from the same device. Our processes follow current platform security trends to minimize risk, but safe usage practices on the buyer’s side help keep accounts stable.
